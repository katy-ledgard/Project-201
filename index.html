            <h3>Barn weddings</h3>
            <p>Barn weddings have become increasingly popular in the last ten years or so and perhaps you are considering a barn as your wedding venue. There are so many positives to choosing a barn for your venue. Firstly, you get to enjoy the rustic feel with a location that is full of character. Not only that, but barns give you an almost blank canvas so you can really personalise the venue to your tastes. Perhaps the biggest draw, however, is the outdoor space and the backdrops that usually accompanies barns. You will be spoilt for choice with photo opportunities and your guests are bound to be impressed by the beauty if you choose a barn for venue. So what are you waiting for, have a look at our barn recommendations today.
